CodeBook for the tidy dataset
=============================

Data source
-----------
This dataset is derived from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" which was originally made avaiable here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Feature Selection 
-----------------
The README outlines the features selected as highlighted in features.txt in the dataset.

Generally I removed all of the characters and fields that didn't directly describe the variable or indicate that the variable is associated with the mean or std deviation.

The assignment calls for measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
